# cuddly-octo-broccoli
My CS Project

This Project is based off the creation "Ridable Segway Clone" by jrowberg. I will be using his code. At the moment i haven't yet
got the required parts, but once i can build my device, i will be editing the code as need be to fit my specifics
 The Arduino code will take inputs from a digital MPU6050 IMU and a few switches.  
The resulting serial output is used to control a Saber motor controller by Dimension Engineering.
You will need to use the I2C device library in order to run the code.
To use the library, just place the I2Cdev .cpp/.h or .c/.h source files and any device library .cpp/.h or .c/.h source files in the same folder as the sketch, and include just the device library headers that you need. i will provide the header files
